    "1. One-Hot Encoding: This method involves creating a new binary feature for each possible value of the nominal variable.

    "The process of converting numeric features to categorical features is known as binning or discretization. There are two primary methods for binning numeric features:\n",
    "1.\tEqual-width binning: This method involves dividing the range of possible values into a set number of equally sized bins. For example, if we have a numeric feature with values ranging from 0 to 100 and we want to divide it into 5 bins, we would create bins of width 20: [0,20), [20,40), [40,60), [60,80), and [80,100].\n",

    "Once the bins have been created, the numeric feature can be converted to a categorical feature by assigning each observation to its corresponding bin. Each bin then represents a category or level of the categorical variable.\n",

The idea is to take advantage of the strengths of each method and overcome their weaknesses.\n",
    "2. The hybrid approach begins by selecting a large set of candidate features using a filter method, which uses statistical measures to rank the features according to their relevance to the target variable. Then, a wrapper method is used to evaluate the subset of features selected by the filter method by training and testing the model with different combinations of features. This allows the wrapper method to take into account the interactions between the features and select the subset of features that leads to the best model performance.\n",

This allows the model to learn the best set of features for the specific machine learning algorithm and optimize the feature selection in an iterative manner.\n",
