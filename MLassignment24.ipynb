Elbow method: This method involves calculating the sum of squared distances between the data points and their assigned cluster centers (also known as inertia) for different values of k (the number of clusters).

This point represents the optimal number of clusters for the data.\n",

The goal of novelty detection is to identify previously unknown data points that do not belong to any of the known classes or clusters. Novelty detection is often used in detecting new fraud patterns, malware detection, or intrusion detection in computer networks. Unlike anomaly detection, novelty detection assumes that the data points are not inherently anomalous but rather new and different from the known data. Novelty detection typically uses density estimation, distance-based methods, or support vector machines to identify the novel data points."
