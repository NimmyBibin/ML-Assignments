    "1.\tDefine the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability is a statistical interpretation of probability that is based on Bayes' theorem. It views probability as a measure of our degree of belief or uncertainty about an event, given the available evidence or information. In this interpretation, probability is not an inherent property of the event or the physical world, but a measure of our subjective belief or confidence in the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Bayesian interpretation, the probability of an event can be updated or revised as new evidence or information becomes available. Bayes' theorem provides a mathematical framework for updating the probability of an event, given prior knowledge or beliefs and new evidence.\n",
    "The formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "•\tP(A|B) is the probability of event A given evidence B (the posterior probability)\n",
    "•\tP(B|A) is the probability of evidence B given event A (the likelihood)\n",
    "•\tP(A) is the prior probability of event A (before considering evidence B)\n",
    "•\tP(B) is the probability of evidence B (the normalizing constant)\n",
    "Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief (represented by P(A)) in light of new evidence (represented by P(B|A)) to obtain a new or revised belief (represented by P(A|B)), which takes into account both the prior belief and the new evidence.\n",
