    "2.Data preprocessing: Once the data has been collected, it may need to be preprocessed to ensure that it is in a suitable format for the machine learning algorithm. This could involve tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into numerical format.\n",

    "5.Model training: Once the machine learning algorithm has been selected, the model needs to be trained on the data.
