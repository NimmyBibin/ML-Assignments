    "The estimated depth of a Decision Tree trained on a one million instance training set depends on several factors, including the complexity of the data and the hyperparameters used in training. In general, an unrestricted Decision Tree could potentially have a depth of one million, but it is highly unlikely that such a tree would be useful for prediction. In practice, the depth of a Decision Tree is typically limited to prevent overfitting, which could cause the model to perform poorly on new data. The actual depth of a Decision Tree for a given dataset can be determined through experimentation and tuning of the hyperparameters."

This is because the decision tree algorithm is designed to split the nodes in such a way that the resulting subsets of instances have lower impurity than the original set. The Gini impurity can decrease or remain the same after a split, but it cannot increase. Therefore, the Gini impurity is not always lower or greater; it is usually lower."

    "Yes, it is a good idea to reduce the max depth if a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set. When a Decision Tree is overfitting, it means that the model is too complex and has learned the noise in the training data, which leads to poor performance on new data. By reducing the max depth, the Decision Tree will become less complex, and the model will generalize better to new data, reducing overfitting. However, it is important to note that reducing the max depth too much can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple and cannot capture the patterns in the data. Therefore, it is essential to tune the max depth parameter to achieve the best balance between underfitting and overfitting."
