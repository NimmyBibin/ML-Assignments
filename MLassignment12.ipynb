    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a consistent learner is a learning algorithm that converges to the true underlying function as the size of the training data approaches infinity. In other words, as the amount of training data increases, the consistent learner will make fewer and fewer mistakes and eventually make no mistakes on any new data that it encounters.\n",

This means that as the number of training examples n approaches infinity, the probability that the learned hypothesis is not equal to the true underlying function goes to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent learners are highly desirable because they guarantee that the learned model will generalize well to new data, even if the training data is noisy or incomplete. Many popular learning algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, have been shown to be consistent under certain assumptions about the data and the learning process."

The choice of prior can also be subjective and may depend on the domain knowledge of the user.
